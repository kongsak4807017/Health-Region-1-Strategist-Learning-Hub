# Data-Driven Problem Solving Playbook

Use this playbook when the task is to create new knowledge, run research, or solve a problem with data.

## 1. Decision Framing
- State the decision and who owns it.
- List actions the analysis will enable.
- Define success metrics and acceptable tradeoffs.

## 2. Questions and Hypotheses
- Translate the decision into 2-5 analytic questions.
- Draft hypotheses and assumptions.
- Define the target variable and any segmentation needed.

## 3. Data Inventory and Quality
- List candidate sources, ownership, and access method.
- Evaluate completeness, timeliness, and bias.
- Identify gaps and propose collection or proxy strategies.

## 4. Method Selection
- Descriptive: summarize what happened and why it might be happening.
- Diagnostic: isolate drivers using segmentation or simple models.
- Predictive: forecasting or classification with validation.
- Causal: experiments, quasi-experiments, or causal inference methods.

## 5. Evaluation and Robustness
- Define baselines and success thresholds.
- Use out-of-sample validation or pre/post comparisons.
- Run sensitivity checks on key assumptions.

## 6. Reproducibility and Documentation
- Version control data, code, and outputs.
- Record parameters, environments, and data snapshots.
- Keep a decision log that links to evidence.

## 7. Risks, Ethics, and Deployment
- Identify fairness or privacy risks.
- Plan monitoring for drift or unintended impacts.
- Specify ownership for post-decision tracking.

## Deliverable Checklist
- Problem statement and decision scope
- Data inventory and quality notes
- Analysis plan and method selection
- Results with uncertainty and limitations
- Recommendation tied to decision options
- Next experiments or data collection plan
